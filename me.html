    <h1>Heikki Laakkonen - a junior web developer</h1>

    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>My name is Heikki Laakkonen and I am a Master of Science in organic chemistry. I graduated in the University of Jyväskylä back in 2015. I specialised in nanosciences and my pro gradu was about the folding of aromatic amidefoldamers. The title of my thesis was like that, 'Aromatic amidefoldamers'. Maybe that tells something about my creativity. For those who do not know that much about chemistry, 'aromatic' describes a type of chemical compounds, amide is a type of functional group and foldamers are synthetic compounds that fold and have a 3D structure, a bit like very simple artificial proteins.</p>

    <p class="question">Alright, you have a degree in chemistry, so what about this web development thing?</p>

    <p>Glad that you asked! I admit I am a bit late for that. I do not have a meaningful background what comes to computers or programming. The first spark was when I was writing my pro gradu. It was not too hard for me, I am a written oriented person, but there was another thing I was perhaps more into. Instead of writing the thing with Microsoft Word I had heard of a better alternative, LaTeX, a typesetting system, and decided to learn and use it. I enjoyed solving the problems what came to the setting of elements in my pro gradu. More control than that Word ever gives. It was not particularly programming but now I see it as a step to html. And hey, I did my first 'Hello World' with LaTeX.</p>

    <p>It took few years before I took the next step. I had tried to get a foothold in the field of chemistry but to no avail. While I was a bit frustrated that gave me the opportunity to educate myself into a more promising field, IT. I started my training programme in Jyväskylä University of Applied Sciences (JAMK) in 2017. After the first semester I had learned the basics of programming (in C++) and web page development (html, css, and very little JavaScript). I liked all of it. Also my first encounter with Linux and Mac. (I wish I have had an opportunity to learn Linux before.)</p>

    <p>The second semester taught me the basics of databases and SQL. There was also more about ICT infrastructure. I learned a lot but I have to say that I am not tech-savvy person and that did not change it.</p>

    <p>The third semester provided me knowledge about web development, that is JavaScript, Angular, Nodejs and such. It was not that easy for me and I took my time to complete the study module. Also, during the third semester there was my first encounter with Git. Another interesting subject. We got also insight in software development. A very interesting and useful course.</p>

    <p>The fourth semester was around Ticorporate. I was a developer in a group that developed a mobile stamp application. We used Nativescript for frontend. Backend was in Heroku and the database in Amazon (AWS). It was a great group, I was happy to be part of it.

    <p>During the fifth semester I was doing my trainee time</p>

    <h3>Other stuff - hobbies</h3>

    <p class="note">This part does not contain anything important about my skills, so you can freely skip it. But if you want to a bit more about me behind my skill, read on.</p>

    <p>As many other, I like to read once in a while and watch movies and tv series. If you want to know, my favorite authors are J.R.R. Tolkien, Alexander Dumas (younger) and Väinö Linna. And G.R. Martin. I have also read many nonfiction books about history, mainly about ancient Greece and Rome and war history. I hope to read the Russian classics at some point.</p>

    <p>Movies are a bit harder category. Well, Steven Spielberg is a great director, and George Lucas has done great things. Top5 movies would be Saving Private Ryan, The Lord of the Rings trilogy (is that cheating?), Terminator 2: The Judgment Day. I have to think about the last two.</p>

    <p>Tv series are also difficult category. There are so many good ones. HBO has done great entertainment. Band of Brothers, Rome, Six Feet Under. Game of Thrones (though the books are better). Breaking Bad. Frasier. West Wing. I have watched a lot of Friends. Also, Big Bang Theory was a good sitcom.</p>

    <p>Video games have been great fun. Command & Conquer. Heroes of Might and Magic series. Half-Life. Civilization (IV and V).</p>

    <p>Outdoor stuff. I have been yearly in northern Norway with my family for years. I like to ride a bike, and joggling is not strange to me. The most I love to do disc golf.</p>

    <p>I save the one hobby that has took the most of my free time for the last decade. Board gaming. When I found about board games, it quickly surpassed video games. I so much like that I can challenge my problem solving skills in games that at the same time give me a chance to social in that environment. I have played over 1000 different board games and expansions. Of some of them I have written reviews. I have been part of the playtesting group for the ones I really really love (with one exception). Should you need a mentor for board games, there are not many better ones than me.</p>
