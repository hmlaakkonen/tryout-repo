    <h1>Heikki Laakkonen - a junior web developer</h1>

    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>My name is Heikki Laakkonen and I am a Master of Science in organic chemistry. I graduated in the University of Jyv채skyl채 back in 2015. I specialised in nanosciences and my pro gradu was about the folding of aromatic amidefoldamers. The title of my thesis was like that, 'Aromatic amidefoldamers'. Maybe that tells something about my creativity. For those who do not know that much about chemistry, 'aromatic' describes a type of chemical compounds, amide is a type of functional group and foldamers are synthetic compounds that fold and have a 3D structure, a bit like very simple artificial proteins.</p>

    <p class="question">Alright, you have a degree in chemistry, so what about this web development thing?</p>

    <p>Glad that you asked! I admit I am a bit late for that. I do not have a meaningful background what comes to computers or programming. The first spark was when I was writing my pro gradu. It was not too hard for me, I am a written oriented person, but there was another thing I was perhaps more into. Instead of writing the thing with Microsoft Word I had heard of a better alternative, LaTeX, a typesetting system, and decided to learn and use it. I enjoyed solving the problems what came to the setting of elements in my pro gradu. More control than that Word ever gives. It was not particularly programming but now I see it as a step to html. And hey, I did my first 'Hello World' with LaTeX.</p>

    <p>It took few years before I took the next step. I had tried to get a foothold in the field of chemistry but to no avail. While I was a bit frustrated that gave me the opportunity to educate myself into a more promising field, IT. I started my training programme in Jyv채skyl채 University of Applied Sciences (JAMK) in 2017. After the first semester I had learned the basics of programming (in C++) and web page development (html, css, and very little JavaScript). I liked all of it. Also my first encounter with Linux and Mac. (I wish I have had an opportunity to learn Linux before.)</p>

    <p>The second semester taught me the basics of databases and SQL. There was also more about ICT infrastructure. I learned a lot but I have to say that I am not tech-savvy person and that did not change it.</p>

    <p>The third semester provided me knowledge about web development, that is JavaScript, Angular, Nodejs and such. It was not that easy for me and I took my time to complete the study module. Also, during the third semester there was my first encounter with Git. Another interesting subject. We got also insight in software development. A very interesting and useful course.</p>
